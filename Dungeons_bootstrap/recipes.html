                    Hello everyone, a bit late for the Tolkien Reading Day and the one ring's destruction date but hopefully you all enjoy those two versions of Lembas I made for you!

                    This recipe is inspired by old cookies, and shortcakes, just let the ones Tolkien might have been familiar with during his childhood. The Lembas are known to feed a man for a whole day with just one bite, and according to the manuscript of Dangweth PengoloÃ° in the book "The Peoples of Middle-earth" they were made from a special flour from a corn that was given to the Eldar by the Valar. It's important to note that corn itself is an old european word and for Tolkien's British English it could mean any kind of grain, actually the most common one in England would be wheat.

                    For this dough I chose to use common wheat, almond flour, honey, butter and oats to help to provide more energy, fiber and protein, after all it's a very nutritious bread!

                    Recipe:

                    1 and 1/2 cup of wheat
                    1 cup of fine oatmeal
                    1 cup almond flour
                    1 cup of honey
                    1 egg
                    1/2 tablet of butter (100g)
                    A bit of salt
                    A pinch of nutmeg
                    Zest and juice of half a lemon
                    You can use a drop of vanilla if you want.

                    Cut the chilled butter into cubes, incorporate with the flours with your fingertips until you make a crumble. Add one beaten egg and the rest of the ingredients. Mix and make a ball, like pie or cookie dough. Chill in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes, then divide into portions of the desired size and roll them with a pin or by hand individually, not too thin, I recommend the thickness of a finger. To make the shape of lembas you can cut them to make a rectangle, or shape it with your hands. Make the classic diagonal cuts that divide it into four, taking care not to cross. Bake for 30-40 minutes at 180 degrees. Allow to cool and wrap in mallorn leaves (if you don't have any you can improvise ðŸ˜‚).

                    Ps: they can also be baked twice to last longer and stay more dry, they were probably made just like biscuits instead of breads. In this case, just wait for it to cool and bake again for another 20 minutes at 130-150 degrees.

                </p>
