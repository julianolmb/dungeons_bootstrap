                A letter from a man named Auden Saerus to his beloved daughter Amellia as found by another adventurer.
                "I grew comfortable around this splendorous grove where the leaves from the trees shine like gold during the autumn. I who was once an avidious traveler and had seen almost every corner of the world, the highest mountains, the clearest lakes, the deserts and the snow, haven't found anything as beautiful as my grove. It must've been more than ten years by now since the day I adventured with my group for the last time, but our last day together will forever haunt my memories. Back in those days we were filled with confidence and drive and our hearts were in the right place - wherever the gold was. I wouldn't say that any of us had ill intentions or anyone in particular deserved the end they had but truth be told we deserved no sympathy either. I remember well the joy of seeing the quays of Golden Port after more than six months in the sea. We had returned from a long, dangerous, yet profitable quest given to us by a wizard whose name I will cautiously refrain from referencing in this letter. The task itself felt simple, to find a lost tome, but we knew there would be unexpected dangers as we were offered substantially more coins than anyone would ever pay for such a conventional venture. This tome was to be found on a tower on an unmapped island deep into the sea and the details about it's location were as vague as the details about the contents of the tome itself. On our long journey on the sea we bonded with the crew and the captain of our small hired ship, I can still remember the sound of their joyful laughs, but I seem to have forgotten their faces. The dangers we faced we many - from untamed weathers, pirates, exotic sea creatures that even I who grew up here had never seen before, to our own weary minds. But despite the long struggle we found the island. On it there was nothing but sand and the tower, it's bricks black as the bottom of the sea. An unsettling feeling grew inside of us and we disembarked, we came prepared to overcome something, but there was nothing but silence and a sense of motionlessness..."
                Inside the tower were subtle signs that someone inhabited it in a long ago, but nothing more than it. After a brief search we found a chest holding a dark brown leather cover tome. A peak inside the tome revealed extense writings on a language that not even our sorcerer Lanya could understand. Now back to the day we docked in Golden Port, we were successful and nobody died, everyone got paid and the wizard got it's tome - a great adventure. Therefore, in the same night everything changed. I think it was past noon, there were just us drinking and cheering in my favourite tavern, you know the one, and I was about to go home for you and your mother. Then suddenly we all felt an enormous pressure on our heads and from that moment on I can only remember fragments of what happened. All of us lost consciousness, some sort of voice saying words that albeit indistinguishable were intelligible to us. The voice was compelling us to do something - to take our lives. It happened in a matter of minutes, I remember my friends walking altogether towards the end of pier, and there when I looked down to the sea I recall seeing hundreds of grim inhuman eyes and mouths floating in the sea. I can't really form a clear image in my head, but it felt so ghastly that I couldn't breathe. One by one my friends silently ripped their own throats and dove into the water. Their corpses vanished, ripped apart,
                mangled by the sharp teethed mouths in the sea. I saw all of them disappear as the eyes gazed upon me and I knew it was my turn. My hands reached my dagger without hesitation, quickly moving to my throat as I gazed back into the sea. But on this moment a memory rushed into my head, I was going to see you and your mother, I couldn't die, it felt impossible for me to do so. I started again to feel my heart pulsing as the cold dagger touched the veins on my throat, my hands froze. The eyes in the sea just kept staring without any change while my body was shaking and I was fighting to regain consciousness. The spasms were so violent that my throat was being cut open even if I was fighting against it, and as I bled slowly, the mouths smiled with a sadistic grimmace. Last thing I remember was the eyes and the mouths sinking into the sea while I refused to die and my blood soaked the boards of the pier. I blacked out and woke up at the temple with you and mother at my side. I then learned later that day that the whole crew of the ship had the same tragic fate of the rest of my group. Even to this day I'm not sure if it was my will alone that kept me alive. And now you know the reason why I don't go near the sea ever again, I fear it will look back at me to finish what it started. That's why I never left your side or your mother's when she was alive, I never knew if I would survive another day. Now you are a grown woman my dear Amellia and you're going on your first adventure. My heart is filled with joy and pride, I know you'll do great things, you're my daughter after all. If you're reading this letter I'm certain you found your dinner alongside with it. I made your favourite dish - smoked mackerel with broad beans and everything from our garden. I hope this loving memory I'm offering serves you as an anchor to always pull you back home safely and to bring comfort during the hardest moments and grieves you will endure, just as the memories of you and your mother saved me in the past.
                Safe travels my beautiful daughter. 
                Auden Saerus
